# Plasticity_Selection
R code associated with a study of thermal plasticity's fitness costs and trade offs. This study was conducted on the intertidal copepod *Tigriopus californicus*. 

This repository contains three .Rmd files pertaining to analysis
* *In situ* temperature data from splashpools inhabited by *T. californicus* in Temp_Time_Series.Rmd
* Models of variation in upper thermal tolerance ($LT_50$) in F3_LT50.Rmd
* Models of the fitness costs of thermal tolerance, its plasticity, and trade offs between these two traits in Sel_Grad.Rmd
